    "\n",
    "ANS-In Pandas, both loc and iloc are used to access data in a DataFrame, but they differ in the way they allow you to select data.\n",
    "\n",
    "loc:\n",
    "loc is primarily label-based indexing, meaning you use the actual row and column labels to access data.\n",
    "When using loc, you specify the row and column labels as arguments.\n",
    "The row and column labels can be strings, integers, or other data types assigned as index/column names.\n",
    "It is inclusive of both the start and end values when slicing.\n",

    "When using iloc, you provide the integer index positions to access data.\n",
    "The row and column indices are represented by integers starting from 0.\n",
    "It is exclusive of the end value when slicing, similar to how Python slicing works.\n",
